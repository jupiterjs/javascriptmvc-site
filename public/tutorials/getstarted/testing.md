JavaScriptMVC puts a tremendous emphasis on 
testing. It uses [FuncUnit] to easily write 
tests that can be run in the browser or automated. FuncUnit
integrates:

 - QUnit - Assertions and testing structure
 - Syn - Synthetic user events like clicking and typing
 - Selenium / PhantomJS - Browser automation

When you scaffolded recipe, it created tests and test pages for you. This 
guide will show you how to:

- Run tests.
- Understand the unit tests.
- Run functional tests.
- Understand the functional tests.
- Test isTasty functionality.

## Run Tests

To run all of __cookbook's__ tests, open
`cookbook/test.html` in a browser. You should
see something like [//cookbook/test.html this].

To run those same tests with [funcunit.selenium Selenium], run:


    > ./js funcunit/open/selenium cookbook/test.html

You should see something like:

<div class='whisper'>
	If Selenium is unable to open your browsers, it's likely you have them in an
	unusual location.  Read the Other Browsers section in [funcunit.selenium Selenium] 
	docs for information on how to configure browsers so selenium can find them.

this code works.

## Tiered testing

If an application should be built of small, isolated modules that are glued together, its tests should reflect that.

Cookbook's modules are each designed to be built and tested independently. For example, the `cookbook/recipe/create` module has its own tests and test page. Open [//cookbook/recipe/create/test.html cookbook/recipe/create/test.html]
and it will run the tests in  `cookbook/recipe/create/create_test.js`.

To test the "glue", `cookbook_test.js` loads all modules' tests 
and provides an integration test, verifying the application as a whole works as expected.

The following goes through:

 - cookbook/models/recipe_test.js
 - cookbook/recipe/create/create_test.js
 - cookbook/recipe/list/list_test.js
 - cookbook/cookbook_test.js

## recipe_test.js

`cookbook/models/recipe_test.js` unit tests the 
`cookbook/models/recipe`, module which is aliased as Recipe. It starts 
by loading the `Recipe` model, QUnit, and the fixtures
used to simulate the server:

    steal( "./recipe.js", 
        "funcunit/qunit", 
        "cookbook/models/fixtures", 
        function( Recipe ){

Next it specifies which module the following tests belong to:

    module("cookbook/models/recipe");
    
Then, it defines a `findAll` test: 

	test("findAll", function(){
		expect(4);
		stop();
		Recipe.findAll({}, function(recipes){
			ok(recipes)
	        ok(recipes.length)
	        ok(recipes[0].name)
	        ok(recipes[0].description)
			start();
		});
	});

The `findAll` test calls `Recipe.findAll` and
attempts to verify that it returns recipes with
a name and description.

Because `Recipe.findAll` is asynchronous, this
test calls QUnit's `stop` and `start` methods
to signal when the test is complete.

`recipe_test.js` goes on to test the remainder of 
`Recipe`'s CRUD methods: create, update, destroy.

## create_test.js

`cookbook/recipe/create/create_test.js` tests 
the `cookbook/recipe/create` module aliased as
RecipeCreate.  It starts by loading funcunit, the 
RecipeCreate control, the Recipe model and
the recipeStore fixture:

    steal('funcunit', 
	    './create.js',
	    'cookbook/models/recipe.js',
	    'cookbook/models/fixtures', 
	    function (S, RecipeCreate, Recipe, recipeStore ) {

Next, it defines the module, with setup and teardown 
code that runs before and after every test:

    module("cookbook/recipe/create", {
        setup: function(){
            $("#qunit-test-area")
                      .append("<form id='create'></form>");
            new RecipeCreate("#create");
        },
        teardown: function(){
            $("#qunit-test-area").empty();
            recipeStore.reset();
        }
    });

`setup` creates a _form_ element and creates a new `RecipeCreate` instance

on it.  `teardown` removes the element and [can.fixture.store.reset resets] the
`recipeStore` to contain the original set of recipes.

`create_test.js` tests that RecipeCreate can create a recipe:

    test("create recipes", function () {
    	   ...
    });

We are going to create an __Ice Water__ recipe, so we
listen to a recipe being created and check it's contents like:

    stop();
    Recipe.bind("created",function(ev, recipe){
        ok(true, "Ice Water added");
        
        equals(recipe.name, 
            "Ice Water", 
            "name set correctly");
            
        equals(recipe.description, 
            "Pour water in a glass. Add ice cubes.", 
            "description set correctly" );
            
        start();
        Recipe.unbind("created",arguments.callee);
    })
		
As this test is asynchronous, it calls QUnit's stop and start. After
listening to Recipes being created, the test creates
a recipe by simulating a user filling in the recipe form and clicking submit:

    S("[name=name]").type("Ice Water");
    S("[name=description]").type("Pour water in a glass. "+
                                 "Add ice cubes.");
		
    S("[type=submit]").click();

Then, it verifies the submit button's value is "Creating":

    S("[type=submit]").val("Creating...",
                           "button text changed while created");

Finally, when the value is changed back to "Create", the 
test checks that the form has been reset: 

    S("[type=submit]").val("Create", function(){
        ok(true, "button text changed back after create" );
        equals(S("[name=name]").val(), "", "form reset");
        equals(S("[name=description]").val(), "", "form reset");
    });
		
## list_test.js

`cookbook/recipe/list/list_test.js` tests the `cookbook/recipe/list`
module aliased as RecipeList. It starts by loading funcunit, the 
RecipeList control, the Recipe model and
the recipeStore fixture:

    steal('funcunit', 
	    './list.js',
	    'cookbook/models/recipe.js',
	    'cookbook/models/fixtures', 
	    function (S, RecipeCreate, Recipe, recipeStore ) {

Next, it defines the module it is testing, with setup and teardown 
code that runs before and after every test:

    module("cookbook/recipe/list", {
        setup: function(){
            $("#qunit-test-area").append("<div id='recipes'></div>");
            this.list = new RecipeList("#recipes");
        },
        teardown: function(){
            $("#qunit-test-area").empty();
            recipeStore.reset();
        }
    });

`setup` creates a _div_ element and creates a new `RecipeList` 
instance. That list will be accessible within each test as `this.list`. 
`teardown` removes the element and [can.fixture.store.reset resets] 
the `recipeStore` to contain the original set of recipes.

Then, `list_test.js` tests that RecipeList displays all
the recipes that are loaded on the server:

    test("lists all recipes", function(){
        stop();

        Recipe.findAll({}, function(recipes){
    
            S(".recipe").size(recipes.length,function(){
                ok(true, "All recipes listed");
    		
                start();
            })
        })
    });
    
And it tests that created recipes are added to the list of recipes
by creating a recipe and making sure a corresponding element shows 
up on the page:

    test("lists created recipes", function(){
		
        new Recipe({
            name: "Grilled Cheese",
            description: "grill cheese in bread"
        }).save();
		
		S('h3:contains(Grilled Cheese X)')
		              .exists("Lists created recipe");
	})

To test deleting a recipe, `list_test.js` creates a recipe then
clicks its destroy link and makes sure the element has been removed:

	test("delete recipes", function(){
		new Recipe({
			name: "Ice Water",
			description: "mix ice and water"
		}).save();
		
		// wait until grilled cheese has been added
		S('h3:contains(Ice Water X)').exists();
		
		S.confirm(true);
		S('h3:last a').click();
		
		S('h3:contains(Ice Water)')
		    .missing("Grilled Cheese Removed");
		
	});

## cookbook_test.js

`cookbook/cookbook_test.js` loads all other tests
and tests the `cookbook` module. It starts
by loading FuncUnit and all the other tests:

    steal(
        'funcunit',
        './models/recipe_test.js',
        'cookbook/recipe/create/create_test.js',
        'cookbook/recipe/list/list_test.js',
        function (S) {

Next it defines which module it's testing:

    module("cookbook", {
        setup : function () {
            S.open("//cookbook/index.html");
        }
    });

`setup` uses FuncUnit to open the application's page. Any
FuncUnit commands, for example `S("h1").text()`, will
operate within that page instead of the 
testing window. This is ideal for integration and functional tests.

`cookbook_test.js` then tests if the page contains
JavaScriptMVC's welcome text:

	test("welcome test", function () {
		equals( S("h1").text(), 
		        "Welcome to JavaScriptMVC!", 
		        "welcome text" );
	});

Finally, it tests the integration between RecipeCreate and 
RecipeList by creating a recipe and making sure it is 
listed on the page:

	test("creating a recipes adds it to the list ", function () {
		
		S("[name=name]").type("Ice Water");
		S("[name=description]").type("Pour water in a glass. "+
		                             "Add ice cubes.");
		
		S("[type=submit]").click();
		
		S("h3:contains(Ice Water)").exists();
		S("p:contains(Pour water in a glass. Add ice cubes.)")
		  .exists()
	});
