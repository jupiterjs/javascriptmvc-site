We're going to create a basic cookbook application that
lets us create, and delete recipes. It will look like:

</br>
We'll use JavaScriptMVC's [steal.generate generator scripts] to
assist in setting up your application's
files and folders. They save time creating boilerplate
js, html, and css files.

## Generating an Application

To create your application, open a console window and 
navigate to your [rootfolder root folder], and run:

    > ./js jmvc/generate/app cookbook

This script creates an application folder and
files. Here's what each file does:


    cookbook/                // folder for your app
      cookbook.less          // less for your app
      index.html             // a page for your app
      cookbook.js            // app file, loads other files
      test.html              // app's test page
      cookbook_test.js       // app's tests
      models/                // model & data layers
        fixtures/            // simulated Ajax responses
      scripts/               // command line scripts
        build.html           // html for build script
        build.js             // build script
        clean.js             // code cleaning / linting
        crawl.js             // generate search content
        docs.js              // create documentation



We'll use index.html for our application. If 
you need to make another page for your app you 
can generate it:

@codestart text
> ./js jmvc/generate/page cookbook dev.html
Generating ... dev.html
@codeend

Or you add the steal script to an existing page 
page followed by `?cookbook` like:

    <script type='text/javascript'
            src='../path/to/steal/steal.js?cookbook'>
    </script>

If you open [//cookbook/index.html], you'll see a
JavaScriptMVC welcome screen.  

@image tutorials/getstarted/Welcome.png

<br/>Open `cookbook/index.html` and you will find:

    <script src='../steal/steal.js?cookbook'>
    </script>

This line loads [steal] and tells steal to 
load `cookbook/cookbook.js`. `cookbook/cookbook.js` is
your application file.  Open it and you will find:

    steal(
	    './cookbook.less', 			
	    './models/fixtures/fixtures.js',	
	    function(){					
		
	})

The application file loads and configures your applications resources.  Currently,
it's loading the app's less file, fixtures (there are no fixtures yet).

Now it's time to make some widgets, models, and fixtures that allow us to create and delete
recipes!  

## Scaffolding Recipes

We'll use the scaffold generator to quickly create:

  - A Recipe model for CRUDing recipes on the server
  - A Fixture for simulating a recipe service
  - A widget for creating recipes
  - A widget for listing and deleting recipes

To scaffold recipes run the following in the command-line console:

    > ./js jmvc/generate/scaffold cookbook/models/recipe

Here's what each part does:

__recipe.js__

Creates a recipe [can.Model model] that is used
to create, retrieve, updated, and delete 
recipes on the server.

__recipe_test.js__

Tests the recipe model.

__fixtures.js__

The generator added code to simulate the Recipe Model's Ajax
requests (You might not have a Recipe service).

__recipe/create__

This folder contains the code, demo page, and tests for a
widget that creates Recipes.

__recipe/list__

This folder contains the code, demo page, and tests for a
widget that lists recipes.

__(steal added)__

"(steal added)" means the generator is 
adding a steal call to load
a generated file for you.  For example, 
`cookbook/cookbook.js` now steals `'cookbook/recipe/create'` and `'cookbook/recipe/list'`.

## Page Setup

After the generator runs, your application file (`cookbook.js`)
looks like:

    steal(
        'cookbook/recipe/create',
        'cookbook/recipe/list',
        './cookbook.less',
        './models/fixtures/fixtures.js',
        function(RecipeCreate, RecipeList){
    
        new RecipeList('#recipes');
        new RecipeCreate('#create');
    })

You'll notice that it now loads `cookbook/recipe/create`
and `cookbook/recipe/list` and then tries to add these widgets to the
`#recipes` and `#create` elements.  

However, `#recipes` and `#create` elements did not 
exist! Fortunately, the generator also added their HTML to `index.html` so that 
it includes:
          

## Run Cookbook


That's it. You've created a simple Cookbook 
application. Open cookbook/cookbook.html in a browser. 

@image tutorials/getstarted/Cookbook.png

<div style='background-color: #dddddd;  margin: 20px 0px;padding: 20px'>
<p>
<b style='color:red'>NOTICE:</b> 
If you are having problems and 
using Chrome from the filesystem, it's because Chrome has an
[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416 insanely restrictive AJAX policies on the filesystem].
</p>
<p>
Essentially, Chrome does not allow AJAX requests to
files outside the html page's folder.  JavaScriptMVC
organizes your files into separate folders.
</p>
<p>
To fix this, just run JavaScriptMVC from a web server.
Or, you can use another browser.  Or you can add
`--allow-file-access-from-files` to Chrome's start script.
</p>
<p>
If you're annoyed like we are, 
[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416 star the issue]
and let 
google know you'd like Chrome to work on the filesystem!
</p>
</div>

this code works.

## How it Works

The Cookbook application can be broken into 5 parts:

  - The Recipe model
  - The recipes fixture
  - The RecipeCreate control
  - The RecipeList control
  - The cookbook application that puts it all together

### The Recipe Model and Fixture

`cookbook/models/recipe.js` looks like:

    steal('can', function (can) {
    
        return can.Model(
        {
            findAll : "GET /recipes",
            findOne : "GET /recipes/{id}",
            create : "POST /recipes",
            update : "PUT /recipes/{id}",
            destroy : "DELETE /recipes/{id}"
	    },
	    {});
    });

This loads CanJS's core, which includes [can.Model], and uses it to create a 
constructor function that lets us
create, retrieve, update, and delete models programmatically like:

__create__

    // create a recipe instance
    var recipe = new Recipe({
      name: 'Hot Dog',
      description: 'nuke dog, put in bun'
    })
  
    // call save to create on the server
    recipe.save()

__retrieve__

    // get recipes from the server
    Recipe.findAll({}, function(recipes){
      // do something with recipes
    })

__update__

    // update the properties of a created recipe
    recipe.attr({
      name: 'Bratwurst',
      description: 'nuke bratwurst, put in bun'
    });
  
    // call save to send updates to the server
    recipe.save()

__delete__

    // call destroy
    recipe.destroy()

Of course, we don't have a server to make requests to. This is
where fixtures come in.

### The Recipe Fixture

[can.fixture Fixtures] intercept Ajax requests and
simulate the response. They enable
you to start work on the front end without a ready server.

Open `cookbook/models/fixtures/fixtures.js` and you will this:

    steal("can/util/fixture", function(fixture) {
    
        var store = fixture.store(5, function(i){
            return {
                name: "recipe "+i,
                description: "recipe " + i
            }
        });
    
        fixture({
            'GET /recipes' : store.findAll,
            'GET /recipes/{id}' : store.findOne,
            'POST /recipes' : store.create,
            'PUT /recipes/{id}' : store.update,
            'DELETE /recipes/{id}' : store.destroy
        });
    
        return store;
    });

The scaffold generator added this to simulate a server 
with 5 recipes.  Read more about how this works on
[can.fixture.store store's documentation page].

### The RecipeCreate control

Open `cookbook/recipe/create/create.html` in your 
browser.  This page demos the RecipeCreate control and
lets you create recipes.  It lets us work on a control
independent of the rest of the application.

Open `cookbook/recipe/create/create.js` to find:

    steal('can', 
        'cookbook/models/recipe.js',
        './init.ejs', 
        'jquery/dom/form_params',
        function (can, Recipe, initView) {
    
        return can.Control(
        /** @Prototype */
        {
            init: function () {
                this.element.html(initEJS());
            },
            submit: function (el, ev) {
                ev.preventDefault();
                el.find('[type=submit]').val('Creating...');
                
                new Recipe(el.formParams()).save(function() {
                    el.find('[type=submit]').val('Create');
                    el[0].reset()
                });
            }
        });
    });

This code uses [steal] to load dependencies and then creates and returns 
a control constructor function.  In `cookbook/cookbook.js` that 
control constructor function is aliased as RecipeCreate.  A new instance
is created on the `#create` element as follows:

    new RecipeCreate('#create')

When a control instance is created, the control's `init`
method is called and runs 

    this.element.html(initEJS());
    
`initEJS` is a [can.view.ejs renderer] function that renders
the template at `cookbook/recipe/create/init.ejs` into 
a documentFragment. That document fragment is set as the control's inner html
using jQuery's [http://api.jquery.com/html/ html] method.

When a control instance is created, it also binds event handlers on the
control's element.  In this case, it listens for "submit" events on the element.

When a submit event happens, it updates the submit button's text, then creates
a new recipe.

### The RecipeList control

Open `cookbook/recipe/list/list.html` in your 
browser.  This page demos the RecipeList control. It loads
Recipes from the server, lets you delete recipes, and it also 
listens for recipes being created and adds them to the list.

Open `cookbook/recipe/list/list.js` to
see the control's code:

    steal('can',
        './init.ejs',
        'cookbook/models/recipe.js',
        function (can, initEJS, Recipe) {
    
        return can.Control(
        /** @Static */
        {
            defaults : {
                Recipe: Recipe
            }
        },
        /** @Prototype */
        {
            init: function () {
                this.list = new Recipe.List();
                this.element.html(initEJS(this.list));
                this.list.replace(Recipe.findAll());
            },
            '.destroy click': function (el) {
                if (confirm("Are you sure you want to destroy?")) {
                    el.closest('.recipe').data('recipe').destroy();
                }
            },
            "{Recipe} created": function (Model, ev, instance) {
                this.list.push(instance);
            }
        });
    });

In `cookbook/cookbook.js`, when a `new RecipeList` is created, `init` is 
called. `init` first creates an empty [can.Model.List]:

    this.list = new Recipe.List();
     
Then it renders `cookbook/recipe/list/init.ejs` and sets the result as
the inner html of the `controls` element:

    this.element.html(initEJS(this.list));

`init.ejs` looks like:

    <% this.each(function(current) { %>
      <li class="recipe" <%= (el) -> el.data('recipe', current) %>>
      <h3>
        <%= current.attr('name') %>
        <a href='javascript://' class='destroy'>X</a>
      </h3>
      <p><%= current.attr('description') %></p>
    </li>
    <% }) %>

In the template, `this` is `this.list`. `this.list` is initially empty so
the inner html of `this.element` is empty. The [can.Observe.List::replace list.replace](items)
method replaces the contents of the list with `items`.  If `items` is a
[can.deferred deferred], it replaces the contents of the list with the
resolved value of the deferred.

The following replaces the items in `this.list` with `Recipes` from the server:

    this.list.replace(Recipe.findAll());

Once the list is updated, the page is automatically updated 
with live-binding. `init.ejs` iterates through the recipes. For each
recipe, it creates an LI element and renders `name` and `description`.

Notice that the view adds each recipe instance to its LI element's data with:

    <%= (el) -> el.data('recipe', current) %>

__Destroying Recipes__

Each recipe has a destroy link.  When it is clicked, the list's
`'.destroy click'` method is called:

    '.destroy click': function (el) {
        if (confirm("Are you sure you want to destroy?")) {
            el.closest('.recipe').data('recipe').destroy();
        }
    }

This method checks if you want to destroy the recipe.  If you do,
it finds the parent 'recipe' element and gets back the recipe instance that's
in jQuery.data. It then calls [can.Model.prototype.destroy model's destroy] method.

When a model is destroyed, all occurrences will be removed from any list. Due to live binding
the recipe on the page will be removed automatically.

__Creating Recipes__

When a recipe is created, a "created" event is triggered.  The List control listens for this
with:

    "{Recipe} created" : function(Recipe, ev, recipe){
      this.list.push(recipe);
    }

When a recipe is created, we just add it to the list we are currently displaying.
Thanks to live binding the list will show the new recipe.

### Putting it all Together

The cookbook application loads both of these widgets and adds them to the page.
When RecipeCreate creates a Recipe, it creates a 'created' event which
RecipeList listens for and adds that newly created recipe to its list
of recipes.

It's useful to notice that `RecipeCreate` and `RecipeList` operate independently of
each other.
