Code \ncoverage is tracked and calculated by [steal.instrument].</p>\n\n<h2>Basic reporting</h2>\n\n<p>To turn on code coverage for any funcunit or qunit test, add the following snippet to the end of your stealconfig.js file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>steal('steal/instrument', function(instrument){\n    instrument({\n        ignores: [\"jquery\",\"can\",\"funcunit\",\"steal\",\n          \"*/test\",\"*_test.js\",\"*funcunit.js\"]\n    })\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the test completes, a coverage report will be shown:</p>\n\n<p><img class='image_tag' src='site/images/coverage_report.png' /></p>\n\n<p>To see which blocks of a file are covered and which are not, click a file's name:</p>\n\n<p><img class='image_tag' src='site/images/coverage_file.png' /></p>\n\n<p>The numbers on the left are how many times each line has been run.</p>\n\n<h2>Ignoring files</h2>\n\n<p>When you're determining code coverage, you won't want to include non application code in your coverage statistics.  JMVC and other third party code will skew coverage statistics.</p>\n\n<p>To ignore files when running from commandline, modify the ignores property shown in the snippet above.  Any string in this array will be matched against files.  Matches will be ignored.  * is used as an asterisk.  *<em>_test.js will ignore any file ending in \n_</em>test.js.</p>", "title": "Code Coverage", "parents": ["FuncUnit"], "order": 6, "src": "funcunit/pages/coverage.md", "children": []})
