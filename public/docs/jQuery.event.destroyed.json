c({"name": "jQuery.event.destroyed", "type": "page", "comment": "<p><code>jQuery.event.destroyed</code> adds a <code>destroyed</code> event that is triggered when an element has been removed.</p>\n\n<p>The destroyed event is called when the element is removed as a result of a jQuery DOM\n<a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/\">manipulation method</a> like <em>remove</em>, <em>html</em>, <em>replaceWith</em>, etc.\nDestroyed events do not bubble, so make sure you don't use live or delegate with destroyed events.</p>\n\n<p>The destroyed event is very useful when you want to remove certain event handlers or clean up references\nwhen the element has been removed. This is very important in order to create long lived applications\nthat do not leak.</p>\n\n<h2>Quick Example</h2>\n\n<pre><code>$(\".foo\").on(\"destroyed\", function(){\n   //clean up code\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Quick Demo</h2>\n\n<div class='demo_wrapper' data-demo-src='jquery/event/destroyed/destroyed.html'></div>\n\n<h2>More Involved Demo</h2>\n\n<div class='demo_wrapper' data-demo-src='jquery/event/destroyed/destroyed_menu.html'></div>", "parents": ["jquerypp"], "src": "jquery/event/destroyed/destroyed.md", "children": []})
