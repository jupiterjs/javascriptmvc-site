It packs best-of-breed\nlibraries and tools that are guaranteed to work together.  It\nsupports every browser that jQuery supports.</p>\n\n<p>If you are new to the framework, this page followed by \nthe [tutorials] is the best place to start.</p>\n\n<p>JMVC's goodies are broken down into four sub-projects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[canjs CanJS] - A client side MVC Framework</li>\n<li>[jquerypp jQuery++] - A collection of useful DOM helpers and special events for jQuery</li>\n<li>[stealjs StealJS] - JavaScript and CSS dependency management and build tools</li>\n<li>[FuncUnit FuncUnit] - Functional and unit testing framework</li>\n<li>[DocumentJS DocumentJS] - Documentation engine</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The remainder of this page highlights each sub-project. Click\nthe the project links on the left for a more in-depth overview \nof the sub-project.</p>\n\n<h2>CanJS</h2>\n\n<p>[canjs CanJS] is a JavaScript framework that makes\nbuilding rich web applications easy and the MVC of\nJavaScriptMVC. The library is extremely lightweight\n(at only 11k minified and compressed) and full featured.</p>\n\n<p>Everything you want and need to know about CanJS\n[http://canjs.us can be found here.]</p>\n\n<h2>jQuery++</h2>\n\n<p>[jquerypp jQuery++] is a collection of useful jQuery libraries that provide the\nmissing functionality necessary to implement and organize large-scale\njQuery applications. It provides low-level utilities for things that\njQuery doesnâ€™t support.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to get started is the <a href=\"http://jquerypp.com\">jQuery++ overview</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>StealJS</h2>\n\n<p>[stealjs StealJS] is a \"code manager\" that keeps code beautiful and organized\nwhile developing and FAST for users in production.  It's a collection of \ncommand-line and browser-based utilities enabling you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[steal load] JS, CSS, LESS, and CoffeeScript files and build them into a single production file.</li>\n<li>[steal.generate generate] an application file/folder structure, complete with test, build and documentation scripts.</li>\n<li>[steal.get install] 3rd party dependencies.</li>\n<li>[steal.clean clean and JSLint] your code.</li>\n<li>make your Ajax app [steal.html crawlable].</li>\n<li>log [steal.dev messages] in development that get removed in production builds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[stealjs StealJS] is a stand-alone tool that can be used without the rest of JavaScriptMVC.</p>\n\n<h2>FuncUnit</h2>\n\n<p>[funcunit FuncUnit] is a web application testing framework that provides automated unit and \nfunctional testing.  Tests are written and debugged in the browser with\nFuncUnit's short, terse, jQuery-like API.  The same tests can be instantly \nautomated, run by Envjs or Selenium.  </p>\n\n<p>FuncUnit also supports extremely accurate [Syn event simulation] on practically every browser and\nsystem.</p>\n\n<h2>DocumentJS</h2>\n\n<p>[DocumentJS DocumentJS] provides powerful JavaScript documenting\ncapabilities.  This whole website is built with it! DocumentJS can document practically \nanything.  It's extensible.  And with Markdown support, it's easy to document your code.</p>", "title": "JavaScriptMVC", "src": "readme.md"})
