Success can be called back with an object that represents\nadditional properties that will be set on the instance. For example, the server might \nsend back an updatedAt date.</li>\n<li><code>error</code> - Create should callback error if an error happens during the request</li>\n<li><code>deferred</code> - A deferred that gets resolved to any additional attrs\nthat might need to be set on the model instance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>findAll( params, success(items), error) -> deferred</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>params</code> - an Object that filters the items returned</li>\n<li><code>success(items)</code> - success should be called with an Array of Model instances.</li>\n<li><code>error</code> - called if an error happens during the request</li>\n<li><code>deferred</code> - A deferred that gets resolved to the list of items</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>findOne(params, success(items), error) -> deferred</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>params</code> - an Object that filters the item returned</li>\n<li><code>success(item)</code> - success should be called with a model instance.</li>\n<li><code>error</code> - called if an error happens during the request</li>\n<li><code>deferred</code> - A deferred that gets resolved to a model instance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>update(id, attrs, success([attrs]), error()) -> deferred</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>id</code> - the id of the instance you are updating</li>\n<li><code>attrs</code> - an Object of attribute / value pairs</li>\n<li><code>success([attrs])</code> - Call success when the request has completed \nsuccessfully.
