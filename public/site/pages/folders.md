/**
@page folders Folder and File Organization

This hasn't been filled out yet.  Ping us and we 
will.  For now, this is a place holder.

Here's what it should dicuss:

  - The app folder and file structure
  - The plugin file structure
    - a plugins folder
  - How apps and plugins should work together
  - Maybe sharing your plugins folder
