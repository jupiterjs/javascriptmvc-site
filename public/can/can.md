### What is CanJS?

CanJS makes building rich web applications easy. It provides a lightweight inheritance system,
bookmark and back-button support, a powerful MVC core with live templates, and more &mdash;
all for about 8k (minified and gzipped).

CanJS is built to work with jQuery, Zepto, Dojo, YUI and Mootools right out of the box.
