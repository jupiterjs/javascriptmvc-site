CanUI is a UI library for CanJS and jQuery. It is not supposed to be a ful UI widget library but
instead provides you the building blocks to create your own UI components the way you want them.
It is designed to be lightweight, with limited options, but flexible enough
to be extended and mixed for richness.  

Here's what's inside:

  - [canui.Fills Fills] - Fill elements
